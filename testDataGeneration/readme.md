# Purpose of this directory
This is for making different data generators for system testing purposes. Data is generated to sqlite database which should be a close
mirror image of the production database. 

# Future development
Later on we might need live data generators for continuous integration testing and system testing.
Also here we have at first fairly simple fake data generators, which can just about be used with data analytics related testing. 
If we want predictive analytics, there is a need for better describe what kind of data shall be generated. 

# AI
When we are at some point exercising Artificial intelligence and ML, there will be more sophisticated data generation needs.
