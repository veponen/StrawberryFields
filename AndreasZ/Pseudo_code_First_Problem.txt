First Version

Make a loop to read all the weights from crops file.
Have to add a " counter " variable to start counting all the weight of the crops ( Has to be inside a loop ).
customer = Ask how many kilos of stawberrys they need
Check if we can provide that amount to the customer. ( Display the result )
available = counter - customer
