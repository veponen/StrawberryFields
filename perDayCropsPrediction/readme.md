# All modules used for daily crops prediction
This is the folder for above mentioned modules. Modules here can be descriptive, prescriptive and predictive. 
# Example
For example, when order for future dates happens, we need to predict based on previously realized if there is 
anything to sell. In the beginning of season we do not have realized crops information, so we can use prediction curve from previous year. When we get realized crops data, we have to adjust the prediction curve appropriately. For that we need to use appropriate mathematical and statistical formulas.
