# StrawberryFields
a study project at LapinAMK
Aim is to give real-life like environment for software development excercises done with python. Another repository like this will be added for javascript later on. 

This project is propably going to have lots of issues, so using it for anyting serious live operations is highly disencouraged. Currently such usage is ofcource impossible also.
